# Brainstorm: $ARGUMENTS

Deep exploration using 10-12 parallel agents for diverse perspectives.

> **📋 OUTPUT POLICY**: All agents follow `.claude/policies/agent-output-policy.md`
> - Tier 1 (Default): Return analysis inline - NO file creation
> - Tier 3 (Patterns): Only with explicit user approval
> - Tier 4 (Decisions): Update shared-context.json after synthesis

## Phase 1: Initial Exploration (Sequential-Thinking MCP)

### 1a. Define the Problem Space

Use sequential-thinking for structured decomposition:

```python
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking(
  thought="Exploring the problem space for: $ARGUMENTS",
  thoughtNumber=1,
  totalThoughts=7,
  nextThoughtNeeded=true
)
```

Key questions to answer:
- What problem are we solving?
- Who are the users?
- What constraints exist?
- What's already been tried?

### 1b. Load Brainstorming Skill

```python
Read(".claude/skills/brainstorming/capabilities.json")
Read(".claude/skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md")  # Full Socratic method
```

## Phase 2: Research & Context

### 2a. Web Search for Industry Solutions

```python
# PARALLEL - All searches in one message!
WebSearch("$ARGUMENTS best practices December 2025")
WebSearch("$ARGUMENTS industry solutions 2025")
WebSearch("$ARGUMENTS common pitfalls 2025")
WebSearch("$ARGUMENTS innovative approaches 2025")
WebSearch("$ARGUMENTS case studies 2025")
```

### 2b. Memory MCP - Previous Brainstorms

```python
mcp__memory__search_nodes(query="brainstorm")
mcp__memory__search_nodes(query="design decisions")
mcp__memory__search_nodes(query="$ARGUMENTS")
```

### 2c. Context7 for Technical Possibilities

```python
# Look up relevant technologies
mcp__context7__get-library-docs(context7CompatibleLibraryID="/facebook/react", topic="patterns")
mcp__context7__get-library-docs(context7CompatibleLibraryID="/tiangolo/fastapi", topic="advanced")
```

## Phase 3: Multi-Perspective Analysis (10 Parallel Agents)

Launch TEN agents for diverse perspectives - ALL in ONE message:

**CRITICAL RULES FOR ALL AGENTS:**
- 🚫 **DO NOT write any files** - Return analysis inline only
- 🚫 **DO NOT create MD files** - No documentation, no reports, no artifacts
- 🚫 **DO NOT use Write tool** - Analysis goes in your response, not files
- ✅ **Return structured text** - Use code blocks and ASCII art for visualization
- ✅ **Keep output concise** - 500-1000 words max per agent

```python

)
```

## Phase 5: Interactive Refinement

Present findings to user with structured options:

AskUserQuestion(questions=[
  {
    "header": "Approach",
    "question": "Which implementation approach resonates most?",
    "options": [
      {"label": "MVP First", "description": "Ship minimal version quickly, iterate"},
      {"label": "Full Build", "description": "Complete implementation upfront"},
      {"label": "Spike First", "description": "Technical proof-of-concept first"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  },
  {
    "header": "Priorities",
    "question": "What matters most for this feature?",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Speed", "description": "Ship fast, iterate later"},

  "name": "brainstorm-$ARGUMENTS-[date]",
  "entityType": "brainstorm-session",
  "observations": [
    "Topic: $ARGUMENTS",
    "Key decision: ...",
    "Chosen approach: ...",
    "Open questions: ...",
    "Next steps: ..."
  ]
